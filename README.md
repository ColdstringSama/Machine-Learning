##  Regression Model Development
  - I use the information in the course case to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.
  

  
## Unsupervised Analysis Project
   - Our team analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This will require an ability to code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret their results. result
